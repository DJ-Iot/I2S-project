# I2S-project

**I2S Audio Playback System with CC13xx MCU and MAX98357A Amplifier**
**Project Description:**

This project implements an audio playback system using a Texas Instruments CC13xx microcontroller and the MAX98357A I2S 3W Class D Amplifier. The system processes input signals to trigger the playback of pre-stored audio files. Audio data is transmitted via the I2S interface to ensure high-quality sound output. The project is developed using Code Composer Studio (CCS), and Audacity is used for audio file creation and management.

**Key Components:**
Microcontroller: TI CC13xx series
Amplifier: MAX98357A I2S 3W Class D Amplifier
Interface: I2S (Inter-IC Sound)
IDE: Code Composer Studio (CCS)
Audio Software: Audacity for editing and storing audio files

**Features:**
Input-Driven Audio Playback: Plays specific pre-stored audio files based on input signals.
High-Quality Audio Output: Uses the I2S interface for clear audio transmission.
Compact and Efficient: Utilizes a Class D amplifier for energy-efficient audio amplification.
